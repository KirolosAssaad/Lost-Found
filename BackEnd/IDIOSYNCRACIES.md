There are some idiosyncracies in this codebase just to remain as simple as possible for students.

* Promises will not be used.
* Foreach loops as well as map/reduce/etc will not be used.
* No bin/ folder.
* All strings use double quotes.
    * Multiline strings can use backticks.
* var is not allowed: the unscoped chaos it creates is more effort than its worth. The newer const/let will be used.
* Lambdas will not be used, but anonymous functions will.
