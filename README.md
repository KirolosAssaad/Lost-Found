## Proposal 
> “2yn 2ashya2y,” an app made by AUCians for AUCians, who find themselves
everyday in the dilemma of having to ask around and scan the whole university
campus looking for their lost items, or even search for hours on different university
facebook groups. On the other hand, some might find lost items and be completely
oblivious on what to do with them, hence this App is to be created just for them.
This app aims to combine all lost items, regardless of their category in one place,
while still keeping the information of the given item concealed so that others don’t
try to steal. Even in the rare cases of having some of the lost items claimed by their
non-rightful owners, the app keeps track of all the found items. As a founder you
get to choose to keep the item with you or put it at any of the lost and found
stations.



## Features

- Large database to cover lost and found items
- Different tabs for different categories of lost items
- Secure login for both the sides
- Secure SMS code validation to receive items
- Security questions before viewing item
- Keeps track of all items (including found ones)
- Blurs items until guaranteed it is yours
- Can upload lost items or found items
- Contacts of all users are maintained for further security
